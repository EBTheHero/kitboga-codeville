# kitboga-codeville
This repository is designed to host Twitch Streamer and YouTuber Kitboga's community-made scripts. Pull requests are welcome, but will be filtered closely. 

### Contributing

Development primarily consists of two methods. They are issues and pull requests. As a general rule of thumb, issues reveal parts of the code that need to be upgraded, and pull requests submit changes. New scripts can request to be added by creating a pull request with that code included. Issues can be created, then the changes submitted through a pull request. Be sure to mention in your pull request which issue it resolves with #\<issue number\>.

Any new programs submitted with a PR should placed in a folder as such: `<repo>/Unofficial/<language>/<project>` e.g. `<repo>/Unofficial/AHK/ahk-windowphysics`.

### KitbogaCodeville Organization
The KitbogaCodeville GitHub Organization is maintained by the public and new members will be invited based on activity. If you wish to be a code reviewer, please message a member of the Organization. Being a member of the Reviewer group will not grant you any special permissions to edit the repository, but will allow you to submit code reviews on pull requests.

#### Review Guide
All submitted changes are reviewed by the community. In order to submit a review, pay close attention to each line of code and be wary to watch for any malicious content. The nature of this repository treads a fine line between fun programs, and unwanted behaviour. Additionally, be sure to run the program for functionality after reading through the code. Check for proper placement of the files in their subdirectories.
**Do not approve changes if there is anything that you see requires a change.** Simply note the section that requires changing, and leave a request for change.
