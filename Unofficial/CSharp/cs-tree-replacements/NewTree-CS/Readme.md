# NewTree

This is a console appliation version of the batch/PowerShell scripts created on Discord

Requires: .NET 3.5
Precompiled version: Not currently available

**THE REAL TREE (`tree.com`) MUST ALSO BE RENAMED TO `realtree.com`.**

This tree-replacement program will randomly select from one of the following functions each time it is run:

- **Neverending Tree**: Cannot be cancelled by keyboard shortcuts, can only be exited by closing the window.
- **Tree Antiwirus**: Outputs an ASCII tree image along with "no malware found" messages.
- **Tree Fork Bomb**: Runs multiple copies of tree in new console windows, reopening them if they are closed. [Disabled!]

It is slightly weighted to prefer the Antiwirus option.
